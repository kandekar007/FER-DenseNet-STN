Add a STN layer in base densenet to achieve higher efficiency. 
# TO RUN:
1. Execute cifar_train.py  (for training)
2. Execute cifar_eval.py   (for evaluation)

## About Code:
1. /data_input has image_generator script
2. /model has densenet architecture and STN module script
3. model is trained on cifar10 dataset and we can use the relevant weights for our project afterwards.
